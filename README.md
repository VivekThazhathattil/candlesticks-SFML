### Ideas left to implement (aka TODO):
* ~~Custom kawaii colors~~ + white bg
* user input html color codes for backgrounds, bullish candles and bearish candles
* ~~x-axis markings~~
* zoomability  (scale time period)
* horizontal mouse drag to change the time period
* detect marubozus, dojis, and other typical single as well as multi-candle patterns.
* draw MACD, get VWAP
* indicate volume
* show help commands upon pressing h 
* refactor hardcoded dimensions
* ability to draw custom lines/ curves
* keyboard shortcut to reset all the changed plot behaviours
